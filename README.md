# Portfolio
Made an official portfolio using the various things which I have self taught myself over time. This website was made using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap frameworks.

Reason for using a bootstrap framework:
The bootstrap framework helped in making sure that i was able to make a grid system that could be sized properly dependingon the user screen dimensions

Things i was able to successfully perform during the creation of the website:
1. I believe that i was able to create an efficient piece of HTML which showed of important parts which i wanted to convey.
2. I was able to carry out ideas which i had before writing code for them.
3. I believe i've gotten better with research and using the piece of information which i have found ont he internet to make my website come out the way i intend it to.

Things i wish i made better:
1. I wish to make it more aesthetically pleasing and making it look more engaging
2. I wish to make the classes have a detailed meaning
3. Make it have comments which describe what each section of code does
4. Make the CSS more structured in an organised manner whcih is able to be understood
5. Create a project section which showcases all the projects which i've done
6. Make text smaller on phone view.

Since this is going to be website of my actual prtfolio from now on, i will be rectifying mistakes which i perfromed and also make sure that it is updated as often as possible in orde to make the website behave much better and to showcase things i've learnt up to that moment.

As of the 8th of September 2023 this i what the website looks like:
